# Movie-Recommendation-System
A movie recommendation system purely based on genre, language, and age rating preferences, using basic data structures such as arrays and structs.
Design a movie recommendation system that offers users personalized movie suggestions based on their preferred genre, language, and age rating. The system should use simple and efficient algorithms to match user criteria with a database of movies and deliver relevant recommendations. Users should be able to interact with the system repeatedly, refining their preferences to discover the most suitable movies.

Motivation

The reason for undertaking this project is to simplify the process of finding movies that match individual tastes. With an overwhelming number of movies available across genres, languages, and age categories, it is often difficult for viewers to decide what to watch.

This system aims to solve that problem by providing personalized movie recommendations, enhancing the entertainment experience. It helps users quickly find movies that align with their preferences, reducing time spent searching and increasing enjoyment.
